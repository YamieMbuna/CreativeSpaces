Top 5 Urban Malawian Producers..

Number 5 – DJ Megi.
Malawian-born, based in South Africa, DJ Megi blends Afro-pop with local Malawian sounds. He’s been instrumental in developing new talent and shaping the next wave of urban music. Notably, he produced Onesimasi’s hits “Controller”. “My Woman” (featuring Lizwi Wokuqala and Janta MW). and “WyDoMeSo”. These tracks have made major waves and highlight his role in bringing fresh sound and energy to Malawi’s music scene. Lowkey, but highly respected.

Number 4 – DJ Sley.
Real name: Sichile Sapa, from Lilongwe. Founder of Chit Chat Records and a force since 2004, Sley pushed RnB, hip-hop, and dancehall into the mainstream. Top productions include “We Run the City”. “Chipapapa” (Tay Grin featuring 2Baba). and “Alamu Anu” (Macelba). He’s curated entire compilations and helped elevate dozens of artists. Drama-free, respected, and deeply rooted in the scene.

Number 3 – BFB (Blaq Falcon Bird).
Real name: Jeremy Matewere, Blantyre-bred and fully self-taught. He broke out in 2006, blending poetic hip-hop with gritty production. Standout tracks: “Pasopa” (with double H P). “Zathapo”. and “Mungovutika” featuring E-Drizzy. He won Best Producer at the 2017 Nyasa Music Awards. He’s proof that lyrical depth and clean production can still shine.

Number 2 – Sonye.
Real name: Sonyezo Kadonje, also from Blantyre. He started young and built his name through hard work, eventually co-founding Baseline Studios and Timve Media Group. Major tracks include “Ukadutsa”. “Kwacha”. and “Tsika”. He’s produced for stars like Tay Grin, Maskal, and Phyzix — and stayed focused on the craft. A visionary with zero hype needed.

Number 1 – The Dare Devils.
Brothers Graiton Daud Pasanje and Marcus Pasanje are the blueprint. Since the early 2000s, they’ve defined Malawian urban hip-hop — starting with T.H.U.G.S. and leveling up ever since. Classic hits like “Khala Pansi” with Jolly Bro. “Rap Nice”. and “Kuusumana” shaped the genre. Their mixtape “Welcome to the Darkside” became a cultural reset.

These five built the backbone of Malawian urban music — behind the boards, ahead of their time. Respect the beatmakers. Respect the culture. Respect the legacy.

Youth Empowerment for Better Tomorrow (YEBETO) is a community-based organization in Lilongwe, Malawi, committed to uplifting young people through education, skills development, and advocacy. YEBETO partners directly with youth to build their capacity in technology and innovation. The organization places a special focus on the use and adoption of artificial intelligence.

Hey besties! Soooo, let’s spill the glitz AND drama behind the Miss Malawi beauty pageant – ya’ll ready? Cuz the tea is hot!

Miss Malawi started waaay back in the 1970s – vintage vibes, right? It’s our country’s OG pageant, meant to show off beauty and brains, with queens repping us at Miss World!

But hold up – it’s been on and off more than your fave situationship! It got suspended, came back in 2001, then ghosted us again till 2017, and only got serious again in 2022. But don’t worry – it’s back in 2025 and ready to SLAY!

Now, here are some queens who wore the crown:

Rachel Landson Phiri, Miss Malawi 2005, age 20 – she’s now in public health and advocacy.

Susan Mtegha, crowned in 2011, age 24 – the model and actress who made headlines at Miss World…more on that in a sec!

Cecilia Khofi, Miss Malawi 2017, age 23 – nutritionist and youth empowerment icon!

Jescar Mponda, 2022 queen, crowned at 22 – beauty AND brains, now into mental health advocacy.


Now let’s get into the messy part… you KNOW it wouldn’t be a pageant without some drama!

2012: Girl, Susan Mtegha shoved Miss New Zealand at Miss World – like literally, palms out! That clip was trending HARD!
2012–2015: Whole pageant went MIA thanks to no sponsors, no management – nada!
2022: Jescar Mponda? She won the crown but had to fund herself – not even a decent budget! Like, where were the coins?!
And the media? They accidentally named the wrong winner – Monica Palya instead of Jescar. Make it make sense!
And don’t even get me started on the online trolls – body-shaming and bullying like it’s their 9 to 5. But 2025 says no more!

So yeah, Miss Malawi has seen crowns, chaos, and comebacks – but 2025 is about to be a RESET. New crown, new rules, new queens!

Who’s gonna snatch the crown this year? Stay tuned and follow for more Malawi pageant tea!

Notable Controversy

Susan Mtegha Profile at Miss World 2012:
https://www.missworld.com/contestants/2012/malawi-2012

Hey, did you know that before colonialism, Malawians had their own powerful cultures, beliefs, and systems of life?
They lived in close-knit communities, believed in ancestral spirits, respected nature, and passed down wisdom through generations.
Life was deeply spiritual, balanced, and rooted in tradition.

But all that started to change when the British came in the late 1800s.
At first, some chiefs thought they were coming to help... maybe stop the slave trade or bring peace.
But it quickly became clear—it wasn’t help. It was takeover.

The British signed sneaky treaties with local chiefs, often in languages and legal terms they didn’t fully understand.
They used military force to defeat those who resisted and took the best land for themselves.
Africans were forced to pay taxes, not in crops or cattle, but in cash.
So how did people get that cash?
They had to work on British farms, in harsh conditions, for tiny wages.
Many were even sent to mines and estates in Zimbabwe and South Africa, far from home.

Meanwhile, missionaries arrived with Christianity and schools.
Yes, they brought reading and writing, and some people benefited from education.
But they also told Malawians their beliefs were evil, their traditions were backwards, and that salvation only came through Western ways.
Whole cultures were pushed aside—what used to be sacred was now seen as “uncivilized.”

People didn’t just sit back.
In 1915, a pastor named John Chilembwe led a bold rebellion, fighting for dignity and justice.
He was killed—but he lit a fire in the hearts of Malawians.
Decades later, Dr. Hastings Banda returned from abroad and led the final push for independence.
Malawi became free in 1964—but the damage had already been done.

So yes, colonialism brought roads, schools, and hospitals.
But let’s be real—it also brought exploitation, land theft, cultural erasure, and generations of inequality.
It wasn’t a favor. It was an injustice.
And while Malawi today is proud and rising, the echoes of that history are still with us.

Know the past. Respect the struggle.
And never forget—we had greatness long before colonizers arrived.

Yo! You think you need mad money to travel? Nah, Malawi got the vibes on a budget.
Here are 10 cheap but legendary spots you can visit without selling your kidney.
Let’s gooo!


---

1. Cape Maclear
Cape Maclear is like the Bali of Malawi… minus the influencers.
Colorful fish that only live here — scientists fly in just to study them, and we swim with them for free.
Locals will roast chambo for you by the lake while telling you how they once saw a mzungu get chased by a monkey for holding a banana. True story.


---

2. Liwonde National Park
Liwonde is where the animals live their best life.
You’ll see elephants so close, your phone camera gets scared.
One guy dropped his chips in the boat trying to take a selfie with a hippo — don’t be like him.


---

3. Zomba Plateau
Zomba Plateau makes you feel like you’re walking through a fantasy movie.
Mist rolls in like you're on Mt. Olympus.
Old school locals still call it “Zomba City,” and you can hike to Queen’s View — named after Queen Elizabeth, who actually visited in the '50s. She probably had tea. You can have thobwa.


---

4. Mzuzu & Viphya Forest
Mzuzu is like the cool cousin of Malawi — chill, green, and underrated.
The Viphya Forest is massive — the largest man-made forest in Africa.
Perfect for hiking, camping, and deep convos around the fire.
Also — Mzuzu coffee? Top tier. Don’t argue.


---

5. Mount Mulanje
Mount Mulanje is where legends are made — literally.
Locals say spirits guard the peak of Sapitwa, and climbers sometimes “get lost” and come back with wild stories.
Bring snacks, water, and a respectful attitude — Mulanje doesn’t play.
Oh, and the waterfall showers? 10/10, would rinse again.


---

6. Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve
Nkhotakota is where history and nature meet.
Used to be a slave trade route — heavy stuff. But today, it’s an elephant sanctuary thanks to conservation projects.
Imagine watching elephants walk across the river while a village elder tells you how their grandfather hid rebels during colonial times. That’s Nkhotakota.


---

7. Chongoni Rock Art (Dedza)
Chongoni is straight up ancient — like 2,000-year-old graffiti ancient.
Caves full of drawings made by hunter-gatherers, and some are still used by Gule Wamkulu today for rituals.
You’ll feel like you stumbled into a Chewa Marvel Universe crossover.


---

8. Likoma Island
Likoma is that flex destination that still doesn’t break the bank.
You can only get there by boat, so just arriving feels like an achievement.
Locals will show you the St. Peter’s Cathedral — so huge it’s got stained glass from Italy and vibes from heaven.
One guy proposed at sunset here — the girl said yes. Then a goat ate their leftover nsima. Romantic AND real.


---

9. Ntchisi Forest
Ntchisi is one of Malawi’s last ancient rainforests — untouched, peaceful, and lowkey magical.
You can hike through the mist, sleep in an eco-lodge, and learn from locals about herbal medicine.
My guy told me chewing guava leaves helps toothache — and it kinda worked. Who needs a dentist?


---

10. Salima & Senga Bay
Senga Bay is Lilongwe’s favorite quick escape.
You’ve got the lake, grilled fish, and local dancers pulling up in full Nyau gear like it's a music video.
One time, a tourist ran away thinking it was voodoo — locals just laughed and kept dancing.
Don’t fear the mask, feel the vibe!


---

So next time you’re broke but still wanna live soft — explore your own backyard.
Malawi is rich in vibes, stories, and culture — and you don’t need a fat wallet to enjoy it.
Tag your squad, charge your phone, and let’s discover home like tourists with brain!

Top 5 Malawian Movies You Need to Watch! 🇲🇼 Let’s dive into the best of Malawian cinema. Number 5 – Seasons of a Life Directed by Shemu Joyah. This powerful drama follows a housemaid, sexually abused by her boss, who gives up her child to pursue education. Years later, she returns to reclaim her son. It tackles justice, women's rights, and modernization in Malawi. Nominated in 8 categories at the Africa Movie Academy Awards. Tapiwa Gwaza even won Best Supporting Actress at the Nollywood Awards. Number 4 – Fatsani: A Tale of Survival Directed by Gift Sukez Sukali. After her school is closed, young Fatsani must survive by selling bananas on the street. A heartbreaking yet hopeful story that was Malawi’s entry for Best International Feature at the 94th Oscars. Number 3 – The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind Directed by Chiwetel Ejiofor. Based on a true story from Kasungu, William Kamkwamba builds a windmill to save his village from drought. A Netflix hit, but received some criticism for casting mostly non-Malawians in a Malawian story. Still, a deeply inspiring film with global appeal. Number 2 – The Last Fishing Boat Directed by Shemu Joyah. An aging fisherman battles modernity, tourism, and betrayal. His son becomes a tour guide, and his wife has an affair with a white tourist who offers to pay for sex. A bold exploration of tradition, culture, and economic pressures. Number 1 – School Days Directed by Bester Kauwa. A fast-paced, nostalgic ride through Malawian school life — bullies, romances, and playground brawls. Filmed almost entirely in Chichewa with English subtitles, it’s authentic and energetic. This is the film that launched Tumpe Mtaya into stardom. Which one have you seen?
